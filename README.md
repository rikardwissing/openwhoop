# BtWearable

BtWearable lets you download and analyze data from a Bluetooth health wearable locally.

Features include pulse tracking, sleep detection, exercise detection, stress calculation, HRV analysis, SpO2, skin temperature, strain scoring, and IMU data collection, all computed locally from raw sensor data.

## Getting Started

First copy `.env.example` into `.env` and then scan for your wearable:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
cargo run -r -- scan
```

After you find your device:

- On Linux, copy its address to `.env` under `WEARABLE`
- On macOS, copy its name to `.env` under `WEARABLE`

Then download history from the wearable:
```sh
cargo run -r -- download-history
```

### Alarm Formats

The `set-alarm` command accepts several time formats:

- **Time of day**: `07:00:00`
- **Relative offsets**: `1min`, `5min`, `10min`, `15min`, `30min`, `hour`

## Configuration

Configuration is done through environment variables or a `.env` file.

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string (SQLite or PostgreSQL) | Yes |
| `WEARABLE` | Device identifier (MAC address on Linux, name on macOS) | For device commands |
| `REMOTE` | Remote database URL for `sync` command | For sync |
| `BLE_INTERFACE` | BLE adapter to use, e.g. `"hci1 (usb:Something)"` (Linux only) | No |
| `DEBUG_PACKETS` | Set to `true` to store raw packets in database | No |
| `RUST_LOG` | Logging level (default: `info`) | No |
### Database URLs

SQLite:
```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://db.sqlite?mode=rwc
```

PostgreSQL:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/btwearable
```

## Importing Data to Python

```py
import pandas as pd
import os

# Heart rate data
QUERY = "SELECT time, bpm FROM heart_rate"

# Other available tables:
# "SELECT * FROM sleep_cycles"
# "SELECT * FROM activities"

PREFIX = "sqlite:///"  # Use "sqlite:///../" if working from notebooks/
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL").replace("sqlite://", PREFIX)
df = pd.read_sql(QUERY, DATABASE_URL)
```

## Protocol

The wearable communicates over a custom BLE service, and this repository decodes the packets locally.

### BLE Service

The device communicates over a custom BLE service (`61080001-8d6d-82b8-614a-1c8cb0f8dcc6`) with the following characteristics:

| UUID       | Name              | Direction    | Description |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0x61080002 | CMD_TO_STRAP      | Write        | Send commands to the device |
| 0x61080003 | CMD_FROM_STRAP    | Notify       | Device command responses |
| 0x61080004 | EVENTS_FROM_STRAP | Notify       | Event notifications |
| 0x61080005 | DATA_FROM_STRAP   | Notify       | Sensor and history data |
| 0x61080007 | MEMFAULT          | Notify       | Memory fault logs |

### Packet Structure

All packets follow the same general structure:

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| SOF | 1 byte | Start of frame (`0xAA`) |
| Length | 2 bytes | Payload length (little-endian) |
| Header | 2 bytes | Packet type identifier |
| Payload | variable | Command or data payload |
| CRC-32 | 4 bytes | Checksum |

### CRC

Packets use a CRC-32 with custom parameters:
- Polynomial: `0x4C11DB7`
- Reflect input/output: `true`
- Initial value: `0x0`
- XOR output: `0xF43F44AC`

### Command Categories

Commands sent to `CMD_TO_STRAP` use a category byte:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `0x03` | Start/end activity and recording |
| `0x0e` | Enable/disable broadcast heart rate |
| `0x16` | Trigger data retrieval |
| `0x19` | Erase device |
| `0x1d` | Reboot device |
| `0x23` | Sync/history requests |
| `0x42` | Set alarm time |
| `0x4c` | Get device name |

### History Data

Each historical reading (96 bytes) contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Heart rate | BPM (beats per minute) |
| RR intervals | Beat-to-beat timing in milliseconds |
| Activity | Classification (active, sleep, inactive, awake) |
| PPG green/red/IR | Photoplethysmography sensor values |
| SpO2 red/IR | Blood oxygen sensor values |
| Skin temperature | Thermistor ADC reading |
| Accelerometer | 3-axis gravity vector |
| Respiratory rate | Derived respiratory rate |

The remaining sensor fields in each packet are decoded and used to compute SpO2, skin temperature, stress, and related recovery metrics.
